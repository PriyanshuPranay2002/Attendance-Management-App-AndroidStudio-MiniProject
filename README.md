# Attendance-Management-App-AndroidStudio-MiniProject

The primary responsibility of the subject handlers is to record attendance in 
class meeting sessions since recording attendance helps encourage students to 
attend lessons. Furthermore, it checks the number of pupils present in the 
classes. Previously, the tasks of registering attendance were done manually with 
a pen and paper. This method takes more time and adds more work to the 
subject handlers, and the data is occasionally prone to error. This research 
provides a mobile application for student attendance management systems to 
prevent these issues. This application is primarily intended for faculty and other 
members of the organization’s personnel who maintain consistent attendance.

Admin has the control of faculty and students’ activity over the app.
Staff users can input, edit, amend, and update the student's attendance using 
any mobile device. 
Student can only view the attendance tab.
